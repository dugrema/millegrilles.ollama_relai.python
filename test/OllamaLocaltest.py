# ### Task:
# Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
#
# ### Guidelines:
# - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
# - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
# - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
# - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
# - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
# - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
# - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
# - Do not use XML tags in your response.
# - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
#
# ### Example of Citation:
# If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:
# * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
#
# ### Output:
# Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.
#
# <context>
# {data}
# </context>
#
# <user_query>
# {input}
